# Spotify-Backup
### Setup
- Create a file with the client id and secret from https://developer.spotify.com called `var.py`
```python
client_id = 'your-client-id'
client_secret = 'your-client-secret'
```
- Run the script
There will be more functionality in the futue. Will be added after I make it work.
