# Spotify-Backup
Does not work yet.

### Setup
- Install the Spotify library: `python3 -m pip install spotipy`
- Create a file with the client id and secret from https://developer.spotify.com called `var.py`
- Add a variable called `playlist_uri` with the uri of your playlist
```python
client_id = '<your-client-id>'
client_secret = '<your-client-secret>'
playlist_uri = 'spotify:playlist:<playlist-uri>'
```
- Run the script
There will be more functionality in the future. Will be added after I make it work.
